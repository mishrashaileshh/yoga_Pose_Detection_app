# yoga_Pose_Detection_app
This is a Yoga Pose Estimation App which can be able to detect the yoga pose in real time by using posenet and KNN Classifier.  This project is done as a part of my internship in the role of Machine Learning Engineer Intern. This project can be extended to a perfect Yoga Trainer to track the poses and retain fitness using AI.
